A _personal_ version of the [Dreamachine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamachine), a "stroboscopic flickering light art device that produces eidetic visual stimuli".

### Status

I thought it was close enough to stick in a box.

Prototype hardware provisionally done. Software, bunch of little bits to do, but tricky concurrency bits mostly sussed. In the process of rewriting encoder lib.
