I have the display working. Next step there is to make it usable. Wrap the display lib into a class that only exposes the functionality I need through simple functions.

The UI will be modal, with the press of a button changing mode.

The display is (rather bizarrely) split into two areas - a top 1/5 or so shows yellow, the rest shows blue.

I guess a simple way of exploiting this is to use the top (yellow) line to show current mode, area below the value.

Brightness : 70%
Frequency : 33 Hz
Phase : 90Â°
Volume : 80%
Wave : sine
Noise : white

It's a dot matrix display so I guess it makes sense to exploit this with some kind of graphic indication as well as text. That suggests three functions :

drawLabel(labelString)
drawValue(valueString)
drawGraphic(graphicObject)

(The latter two can probably be wrapped together somehow, but that can wait until later)

rename to displayXXX()

probably need a display(labelString, valueString) ..?

Had a bit of trouble writing to the ESP32, the USB connection wasn't been recognised.

ls /dev/ttyUSB\*

lsmod|grep usbserial

sudo modprobe cp210x

sudo rmmod cp210x
sudo insmod /lib/modules/5.15.0-43-generic/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/cp210x.ko

uninstall brltty

systemctl stop brltty-udev.service
sudo systemctl mask brltty-udev.service
systemctl stop brltty.service
systemctl disable brltty.service

Got this display example to work (after adding forward function definitions) :

I thought I'd better test the LEDs, just in case. Wound up doing some [sums](https://github.com/danja/dreamachine/blob/main/images/led-driver-sums.jpeg) and [measurements](https://github.com/danja/dreamachine/blob/main/images/led-driver-measure.jpeg)

The LEDs are rated at 1W, 3.2-3.4 V 350mA, but voltage drop was actually about 2v.

I aimed for 100mA drive from a BC109 on a 5v PSU.

With the BC109 common emitter, I found a base resistor of 680R (going to +3.3v) and a collector resistor of 10R (going through LED to +5v) gave me 95mA.

It's not exactly dazzling, but may be bright enough, is certainly good enough for now.

The LED driving and signal generation should be straightforward enough, known territory.

This display is new to me, I reckon try to get that working first, then add rotary encoders.
