# Functional Requirements

Easiest to describe in terms of the user interface.

safety :

- always LEDs off when switched on
- push switch to immediately switch LEDs off
- timer controlling on period - initially. 1 min

User Interface

Assuming one encoder + switch for the brightness, another for everything else (maybe a pot for audio volume?). Make it modal on clicking the switch :

Brightness : 70%
Frequency : 33 Hz
Phase : 90Â°
Volume : 80%
Wave : sine
Noise : white
